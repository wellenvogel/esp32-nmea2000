RS-485 Modbus Serial Implementation
===================================

This directory contains the implementation of Modbus over the RS-485 interface for the cheaper versions of wind sensors.

The specific sensor implemented here is Veinasa XS-WSDS01 Small Integrated Wind Speed and Direction Sensor.

The code for reading the data from the sensor has been adapted from [here](https://github.com/wilson-malone/RS485_Arduino_Wind_Direction_Speed_Sensors)
